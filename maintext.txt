Github(Opens in a new window) is a company that hosts "code repositories", collections of code for projects. Many of the code repositories are "open source", which means they're publicly available for the whole world to browse. That's awesome, because that's how programmers learn from each other and build on each other's work! Khan Academy has quite a few open source repositories. Code repositories can contain all sorts of types of code, not just HTML and CSS - whatever code is needed to make the project work.
Why am I telling you about them? Well, Github has a feature called Github Pages, which makes it easy and free for you to create a multi-file website hosted at yourusername.github.io.
Note: Khan Academy is not affiliated with Github. Please consult the Github Terms of Use and other policies before deciding to sign up for an account, especially if you are under 13 years of age.
Sign up for a Github account
Visit github.com, and you'll see a signup form on their front page. (If you don't, congrats, you already have an account! You can skip to Step 2).
When you're picking up your username, keep in mind that it will be publicly viewable on the internet and it will be in the URL of your website: yourusername.github.io. Some people like to use nicknames or funny names instead of their real name, for privacy reasons, but that's up to you.
